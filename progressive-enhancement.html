        <h2>The story</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his 
            neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has 
                run away. This is most unfortunate</q>. The farmer said, <em>Maybe</em>. The next day the horse came 
            back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, 
            <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer 
            again said, <em>Maybe</em>.
        </p>
        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown 
            and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span></q>, and the farmer responded, 
            <em>Maybe</em>. The next day the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription" target="_blank" title="What is conscription?">conscription</a> 
            officers came around to conscript people into the army, 
            and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and 
            said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <em>Maybe</em>.
        </p>

        <blockquote>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s 
            really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you 
            never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be 
            the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not 
            <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
